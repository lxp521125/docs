This image has been deprecated in favor of the [official `logstash` image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/docker.html) provided and maintained by [elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/). The list of images available from Elastic can be found at [www.docker.elastic.co](https://www.docker.elastic.co/). The images found here will receive no further updates once the `6.0.0` release is available upstream. Please adjust your usage accordingly.

Elastic provides open-source support for Logstash via the [elastic/logstash GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) and the Docker image via the [elastic/logstash-docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docker), as well as community support via its [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash).
